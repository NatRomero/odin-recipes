    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <p> 
        <ol> 
            <li> Begin by making lettuce slices then set aside for later</li>
            <li> In a bowl crack the egg then add the ground beef. Season to your liking, I enjoy salt, onion powder, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li> Mix the ground beef and egg till they are well blended together then make small balls about the size of an egg.</li>
            <li> Place the balls on a plate then use a bowl covered in parchment paper to squish the ball until it forms a patty.</li>
            <li> Place your patty onto a well heated grill or pan and cook on one side for about 3-4 minutes on a medium high heat.</li>
            <li> Flip the patty after the 4 minutes, let it cook for about 2 minutes then add the cheese.</li>
            <li> Remove the patty after an additional two minutes and place it on a bun.</li>
            <li> Add your desired toppings then enjoy with an ice cold soda.</li>
        </ol>
